# Genetic-Algorithm-Based Stochasitic Composition

## Introduction üëã

**Genetic Algorithm (GA)** is applied in machine composition by simulating the process of **natural selection and biological evolution** to automatically generate works that conform to specific musical rules. It encodes music segments as individuals, evaluates their quality using a **fitness function**, and performs evolution through selection, crossover, and mutation operations. After several generations of iteration, the algorithm generates harmonious and creative melodies, harmonies, and rhythms that meet various style and emotional requirements. The global search capability and flexibility of genetic algorithms make them powerful tools in music composition, widely used in melody generation, harmony creation, and rhythm design.

## Methods ‚úçÔ∏è

### 1 Generation of Initial Population

We use a random simulation approach to generate 27 pitch sequences (from $F_3$ to $G_5$ in the musical scale). We use digital encoding (0 as a rest, 1-27 as notes, and 28 as a sustain note). The specific generation function is located in the ```random_initial_population(self)``` function in ```GAmusic.py```.

### 2 Transformations in Each Iteration

We define five transformation methods: ```mutation()```, ```transposition()```, ```inversion()```, ```retrograde()```, and ```crossover()``` (see the corresponding functions in ```GAmusic.py```). A flag parameter is used to decide whether to apply these transformations during the iteration process.

### 3 Natural Selection and Fitness Function

We calculate the fitness of each individual according to the defined fitness function and select individuals from the population using a **probability-weighted** method based on their fitness, to avoid getting stuck in local minima. The iteration stops when either the predefined maximum number of iterations is reached or when an individual‚Äôs fitness reaches a threshold.

The overall fitness function is a weighted sum of 13 functions, each evaluating one aspect of an individual:

**No1.** ```Fitness_NormalStart``` penalizes beginning with a rest or a sustain note.

**No2.** ```Fitness_AvoidUnpreferredPitch``` penalizes appearance of unpreferred notes, while what notes are not unpreferred needs manual design.

**No3.** ```Fitness_AvoidSyncopation``` penalizes rests and sustain notes appearing at the start of the 1st or 3rd beat in a bar (downbeats in 4/4).

**No.4** ```Fitness_AvoidBigInterval``` penalizes intervals bigger than an octave to avoid too sharp pitch change.

**No.5** ```Fitness_GoodInterval``` rewarding consonant intervals like perfect fifth to promote pleasant melodies.

**No.6** ```Fitness_AvoidBigFluctuation``` penalizes big variance in all intervals to improve smoothness.

**No.7** ```Fitness_AvoidContinueUpOrDown``` penalizes continuous same-direction pitch changes in each bar, realized by limiting the interval between first and last notes in a bar.

**No.8** ```Fitness_AvoidNoteRepetition``` penalizes staying at a same pitch whether by sustaining a note or by using new notes of the same pitch.

**No.9** ```Fitness_AvoidNoChange``` penalizes repeated notes with same pitch and duration.

**No.10** ```Fitness_LocalChange``` promotes corresponding local changes by rewarding 3 ascending or descending neighbor notes.

**No.11** ```Fitness_AvoidBigDurationChange``` penalizes bigger duration changes between neighbor notes than 3, promoting relatively smooth transition.

**No.12** ```Fitness_KeepInAnOctave``` promotes more notes to be placed within an octave by rewarding the max number of notes in an octave.

**No.13** ```Fitness_SimilarityBetweenBars``` promotes the similarity between bars by rewarding the proximity of means and vars of their intervals.

Each fitness function outputs a number in **[0,1]**, so their weights can be equally considered.

### 4 From Digital Encoding to Musical Notation

### 5 Visualization

We use **Heatmaps** to represent the fitness values of the population throughout the iteration process, providing an intuitive analysis of how different **hyperparameter selections** affect the iteration.

Additionally, we apply **UMAP** dimensionality reduction to represent each individual as a vector defined by 12 fitness function values and perform clustering analysis.
